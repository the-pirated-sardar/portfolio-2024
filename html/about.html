                                For the longest time, I have been moving from place to place. Not an army brat, just the son of an amazing businessman and entrepenueur. The one constant however, was my love for technology. (It is worth mentioning though, I bent the first MacBook I ever got. Long story, not the best story.)

                                Intuitively I was drawn towards the programming classes at my high school. Not to brag but I was in the top 3 of my class in that phase of life. My interest in programming was sparked and the fire has been burning since (except for the occasional monthly crisis).

                            Being naturally smart was perhaps one of my earliest shortcomings. My late father used to say "You didn't earn that. Now use your brains to earn something". Didn't understand the weight of it until after he was gone. I have been doing my best to live up to those words ever since. (He used to say that I didn't earn my height either. I just think he was being sore about me getting taller than him.)
                            <br><br>
                            I have a whole roster of role models, most of whom have made their way into my life fairly recently. Three of them however have been with me sice the beginnning. My mother, who has put her own life on hold to ensure I have all the opportunities I asked for. My younger sister, who has delayed chasing her aspirations to let me go after mine. And my late father, who now guides the moral compass that resides within me.
                            <br><br>
                            And on a lighter note, I have some other people I look up to as well. Dr. Andrew Huberman, who has been leading by example as a scientist and balanced human being. Mark Rober, who has been a beacon of creativity and innovation. And last but not the least, Hasan Minhaj, who has been a voice of reason and a source of inspiration.

                        One of my cousins once told me, "You're a jack of all trades, master of none." I took that as a compliment. I love to learn new things, and I love to learn them well. I'm a programmer, a writer, a musician, a photographer, a designer, and a lot more. I'm a student, a teacher, a friend, a brother, a son, and a lot more. I'm a lot of things, and I'm proud of it.

                            During the pandameic, a series of events triggered a change in my lifestyle. I went for a routine medical checkup and a few things came up. Most important of all was that my blood pressure would not go below 100, even when I was made to sit still for 5 minutes. I was an overweight teenager, being told I was on the brink of causing irreversible damage to my body. A switch went on inside me. I started working out, eating healthier, and sleeping better. I lost 80 lbs (36 kgs) in 9 months. My identity changed, my confidence changed, and my life changed. I've hit a few bumps along the way, but I'm still on the path to a healthier life.

                            A lot of computing professionals fail to take care of their health. Perhaps it's the sedentary lifestyle, or the stress, or the lack of time. I want to be an example of how it can be done. I want to be a role model for not only the next generation of professionals, but also for my peers. All of us could use a little more health and fitness in our lives. Even if we don't realize it just yet.

                            Honestly speaking, the decision to go abroad was a little hasty. I had been planning to attend university back home but something got my mom thinking about how she and my dad wanted me to go to Canada for higher education. Truth be told, it didn't even hit me what an emotional rollercoaster it would be unitl I was on the plane. One of my frineds asked me a couple days before I left if I felt "gulu-gulu" in my stomach, which loosely translates to butterflies in the stomach. I didn't then, but I have a record of when I did. In my notes, I wrote:
                            <br><br>
                            <em>"Gulugulu @ 4:42 AM (Vancouver time, 25th Aug)"</em>
                            <br><br>
                            I was at a layover in London when that happened. It still does sometimes. It happened the first time I was in boarding school back in 7th grade. And it happens each time I take a leap of faith. I used to associate it with something negative, but now I think of it as a sign that I'm doing something that matters.
