                        Hello there! I'm excited to introduce you to, well, me!
                        <br><br>
                        I'm Prateek, a student of Computer Science but much more.
                        <br><br>
                        For the longest time, I have been moving from place to place. Not an army brat, just the son of an amazing businessman and entrepenueur. The one constant however, was my love for technology. (It is worth mentioning though, I bent the first MacBook I ever got. Long story, not the best story.)
                        <br><br>
                        Intuitively I was drawn towards the 'Computer Science' class at my high school. Not to brag but I was in the top 3 of my class in that phase of life. That sparked my interest in programming and I have been learning and growing ever since.
                        <br><br>
                        Being naturally smart was perhaps one of my earliest shortcomings. My late father used to say "You didn't earn that. Use your brains to earn something". Didn't understand until after he was gone. I have been doing my best to live up to those words ever since.
                        <br><br>
                        I have a whole roster of role models, most of whom have made their way into my life fairly recently. Three of them however have been with me sice the beginnning. My mother, who has put her own life on hold to ensure I have the opportunities I have. My younger sister, who has delayed chasing her aspirations to let me go after mine. And my late father, who now guides the morale compass that resides within me.
                        <br><br>
                        And on a lighter note, I have some other people I look up to as well. Dr. Andrew Huberman, who has been leading by example as a scientist and balanced human being. Mark Rober, who has been a beacon of creativity and innovation. And last but not the least, Hasan Minhaj, who has been a voice of reason and a source of inspiration.
                        <br><br>

                        Extra, not to be included in the final draft:<br><br>
                        One of my cousins once told me, "You're a jack of all trades, master of none." I took that as a compliment. I love to learn new things, and I love to learn them well. I'm a programmer, a writer, a musician, a photographer, a designer, and a lot more. I'm a student, a teacher, a friend, a brother, a son, and a lot more. I'm a lot of things, and I'm proud of it.
